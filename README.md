# HelperScript ðŸ’…

This is the source code of my previously closed-source project, I removed most of the lines were related to my job, so now it can be freely published as a part of my portfolio.

It was made possible by Vite-Monkey plugin that allows full Vite project to be injected as userscript.

## Purpose

The web interface of the project at my job was very old and outdated with many UX issues, to make my job easier I made a userscript that provides useful tooling for faster data input and visualization.
